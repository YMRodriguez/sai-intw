Title: CRISPR Technology: Revolutionizing Crop Development

Abstract: This case study details a specific CRISPR application in agriculture.

1. Introduction
   CRISPR enables precise genome editing in plants.

2. Case Study: Disease-Resistant Wheat
   In 2018, researchers used CRISPR to edit the TaMLO gene in wheat, conferring resistance to powdery mildew. This reduced pesticide use by 30%.

3. Conclusion
   CRISPR offers sustainable solutions for crop improvement.
