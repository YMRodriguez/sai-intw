Title: Environmental Risks of Deep-Sea Mining

Abstract: This report examines the ecological impacts of deep-sea mining and potential mitigation strategies.

1. Introduction
   Deep-sea mining targets mineral-rich nodules on the ocean floor.

2. Primary Environmental Concerns
   - Habitat Destruction: Mining disrupts fragile ecosystems like hydrothermal vents.
   - Sediment Plumes: Stirred-up sediments release toxic metals, harming marine life.

3. Mitigation Strategies
   - Marine Protected Areas: Restrict mining in biodiversity hotspots.
   - Low-Impact Technology: Reduce sediment disturbance with precision equipment.

4. Conclusion
   Balancing resource extraction and environmental protection is critical.
