Title: The Gut-Brain Axis: Microbiotaâ€™s Role in Mental Health

Abstract: This review summarizes evidence linking gut microbiota to mental health, focusing on depression.

1. Overview of the Gut-Brain Axis
   The gut-brain axis connects the gastrointestinal tract to the central nervous system via neural and biochemical pathways.

2. Evidence Linking Microbiota to Depression
   Studies (e.g., Jiang et al., 2015) show that patients with severe depression have reduced levels of Bacteroides and elevated Firmicutes. A 2020 clinical trial found that probiotics reduced depressive symptoms in 60% of participants.

3. Conclusion
   Microbiota composition influences depression severity, offering potential therapeutic targets.
